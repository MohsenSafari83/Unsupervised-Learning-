# 🧩 Unsupervised Learning Projects

This repository contains hands-on implementations and documentation of **Unsupervised Learning** algorithms.  
It focuses on two main areas:  

- 🔹 **Clustering** (KMeans, DBSCAN, Hierarchical)  
- 🔹 **Dimensionality Reduction** (PCA, Kernel PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)  

The goal of this repo is to provide both **practical Jupyter Notebooks** with code and visualizations, and **educational documentation** explaining the theory behind each method.
